## CV Writing Rules

### Format Requirements

- Use UK English terms: CV not resume, driving licence not driver's license
- No em dashes or en dashes, use commas or hyphens instead
- No ampersands in body text, write "and" in full
- No special characters that may break ATS: smart quotes, ellipses, symbols
- Write numbers in words for small values: "50 plus" not "50+"
